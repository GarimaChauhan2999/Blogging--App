        <p>Over the past few days, I’ve watched a lot of commentators explain the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
            They’re talking about insured deposits, venture capital, ripple effects on the economy…. but what do those
            things even mean?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I worked in banking during the 2008 financial crisis (at a tech company with banks as clients). Now I’m a
            freelance content marketer and most of my clients are venture capital-backed tech companies. So I’ve had a
            front-row seat for both crises.

            There’s plenty of information for founders and business owners right now, but what about regular people?
            Here’s some background about what happened and what it means.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <b> What happened in 2008?</b><br>
            For several years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, some banks were engaged in risky business.

            The real estate market was booming. So banks were making a lot of loans for commercial real estate
            (business) and consumer real estate (mortgages).

            The problem was that banks also relaxed their underwriting standards to do these loans. That means that
            maybe five years prior, the bank would have said “Nah, you can’t afford that loan.” And instead, said “Okie
            dokie — here’s your loan!” (Subprime lending was a big problem — banks were knowingly doing loans to
            borrowers with lower credit scores or other risk factors).
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <b> What is a bank failure?</b><br>
            A bank failure happens when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) steps in and says, “Enough. You
            don’t get to do business anymore.”
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Typically, bank failures are not a surprise. The bank will have been struggling for awhile. The FDIC will
            tell the bank, “Hey, you need to get your act together” or “Hey, you need to raise additional money
            (capital) to cover some of these losses you’re experiencing.”

            The FDIC will show up at the bank’s doorstep — at all branches — and shut the bank down. This part happens
            without warning, because if word leaked in advance, it could cause panic at the bank. The FDIC informs the
            bank that they no longer exist and spends one weekend taking over the bank. By Monday morning, the bank
            reopens, either under new ownership or the FDIC’s control.

            The FDIC will try to find a buyer for a troubled bank in advance, through a very secretive process. Finding
            a buyer ensures a really smooth transition for bank customers.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <b>How did the U.S. government step in?</b><br>
            At 6:15 pm EST on Sunday, March 12th, the Treasury, the Fed, and the FDIC issued a joint statement that
            actions had been approved to fully protect all depositors. All accounts at SVB will have full access to all
            of their money on Monday morning.

            The regulators enacted a “systemic risk exception” to the $250k limit. This was used several times during
            the 2008 financial crisis to protect depositors. No taxpayer money is used. The bank management team is
            fired. And the investors of SVB are not protected.
