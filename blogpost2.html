        <p>Git is a powerful tool that feels great to use when you know how to use it.
            I’ve used these features of Git for years across teams and projects. I’m still developing opinions around
            some workflows (like to squash or not) but the core tooling is powerful and flexible (and scriptable!).
        </p> <br>
        <p>Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Git was
            initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. Git is a free software
            distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. This tutorial explains how to use
            Git for project version control in a distributed environment while working on web-based and non web-based
            applications development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Free and open source - Git is released under GPL’s open source license. It is available freely over the
            internet. You can use Git to manage property projects without paying a single penny. As it is an open
            source, you can download its source code and also perform changes according to your requirements.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fast and small - As most of the operations are performed locally, it gives a huge benefit in terms of speed.
            Git does not rely on the central server; that is why, there is no need to interact with the remote server
            for every operation. The core part of Git is written in C, which avoids runtime overheads associated with
            other high-level languages. Though Git mirrors entire repository, the size of the data on the client side is
            small. This illustrates the efficiency of Git at compressing and storing data on the client side.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Implicit backup - The chances of losing data are very rare when there are multiple copies of it. Data present
            on any client side mirrors the repository, hence it can be used in the event of a crash or disk corruption.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Local Repository - Every VCS tool provides a private workplace as a working copy. Developers make changes in
            their private workplace and after commit, these changes become a part of the repository. Git takes it one
            step further by providing them a private copy of the whole repository. Users can perform many operations
            with this repository such as add file, remove file, rename file, move file, commit changes, and many more.

            Working Directory and Staging Area or Index -
            The working directory is the place where files are checked out. In other CVCS, developers generally make
            modifications and commit their changes directly to the repository. But Git uses a different strategy. Git
            doesn’t track each and every modified file. Whenever you do commit an operation, Git looks for the files
            present in the staging area. Only those files present in the staging area are considered for commit and not
            all the modified files.</p>
