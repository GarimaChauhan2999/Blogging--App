        <p>I direct the largest addiction research center in the country, and I study substance use in adolescence.
            Here’s what every parent needs to know about adolescent substance use:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            1. Adolescence is the time when most kids initiate substance use, establish regular patterns of use, and
            many start to experience consequences. About 15% of the population will meet criteria for a substance use
            disorder at some point in their lives, meaning that substance use is causing significant harmful
            consequences. The average age of onset for problems is in the early 20s, so most problems start in
            adolescence. That’s why we focus so much substance use prevention programming on teens.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            2. Adolescents have brains that are wired for risk-taking. This is a result of the fact that the brain
            doesn’t develop evenly. The part of the brain that is highly attuned to experiencing reward is fully
            developed in adolescence. That’s a product of evolution — if our brains didn’t respond positively to food,
            social interactions, sex, as a species we wouldn’t survive very long. Those things make us feel good, and we
            seek out more of them. But as we all know, too much of a good thing can lead to trouble. The part of our
            brain that helps us weigh the consequences of our actions and think about long-term implications isn’t fully
            developed until the mid-20s. So, teenagers are like race cars without fully functional brakes. Using drugs
            is a new novel experience, which adolescent brains crave — and then drugs hijack the reward system by
            producing feel-good effects. It’s a big part of the reason that most adolescent substance use is risky
            adolescent substance use. Teens don’t have a glass of wine with dinner; if one drink is good, their
            reward-primed brains tell them — 5 drinks must be better! Of course, there is a lot of individual
            variability in this trait, but developmentally, teenage brains are at a high point for risk taking.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            3. The drugs available to kids today are more dangerous than in the past.

            Vaping has risen tremendously in popularity, with one in four youth reporting that they have vaped. Vapes
            come in fun flavors and are easy to hide; most youth (and parents) do not realize that a single vape can
            contain as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

            Cannabis use is on the rise as most states have legalized marijuana for either medicinal or recreational
            purposes. Up to 11% of youth report using cannabis daily. This is the drug most of us who study adolescent
            substance use are most worried about presently.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            · Talk to your kids about alcohol and other drugs. Ask your child questions about substance use in their
            school and among their friends. Ask what they think about using alcohol or other drugs. Use this as an
            opportunity to have a conversation about substance use. The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), which
            is a branch of the National Institutes of Health that funds most substance use research in this country, has
            great resources for parents to help you frame this conversation. Be clear about the rules and expectations
            in your house, and — this part is key — outline and implement consequences if they are broken. It’s normal
            for teens to push boundaries, and the unfun part of being a parent is that we have to serve as the referees.
            But unfortunately, this isn’t a game; your child’s life is at stake.
