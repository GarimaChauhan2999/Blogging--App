            Almost 20 years ago, Chris Anderson wrote The Long Tail, which accurately predicted that the Internet would
            fragment attention and consumption would shift into the “tail.” But Top Gun Maverick generated over $700
            million at the domestic box office last year, Bad Bunny had 18.5 billion streams on Spotify last year and
            142 million households reportedly watched Squid Game Season 1 in its first 28 days. Why are there still hits
            in a fragmenting world?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I recently posted an essay called Forget Peak TV, Here Comes Infinite TV. It made the case that over the
            next decade video will follow the path of text, photography and music and the quality distinction between
            “professionally-produced” content and “independent/creator/user-generated” content will increasingly blur.
            This will result in practically infinite quality video content. Will there still be hits then, or only
            personalized niches?

            Have you ever wondered why so many blockbuster movies are about superheroes? Is Hollywood lazy or are
            consumers’ tastes becoming dumber and more homogenized? Or neither?
            Why does something go viral, anyway?
            Do content recommendations push you to the most popular shows, movies and songs or are they tailored just
            for you? Or do they have a different agenda?
            Will web3 really be the savior of small creators?
        </p><br>
        <p>
            This essay may be a little wonky, but the topic is something I’ve been thinking about for more than a
            decade. (Off and on, not continuously.)

            I explain why power law-like distributions — meaning a few massive hits and a vast number of misses — are an
            inherent feature of networks; describe how recommendation systems can either dampen or reinforce social
            signals; show some examples of the persistence of power law-like distributions in media across movies, TV,
            music and the creator economy; and discuss why all this matters.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <b> The Long Tail Was Half Right</b><br>
            The idea that the Internet would cause media fragmentation is almost as old as the modern Internet itself.
            (Or maybe older. The line often misattributed to Andy Warhol that “in the future, everyone will be
            world-famous for 15 minutes” was a pre-Internet prediction of fragmentation.) In 1999, Qwest Communications
            produced an ad featuring a motel with “every movie ever made in every language” (Figure 1). The Long Tail,
            published in 2004, argued that because the Internet dramatically lowered the cost to store and transport
            information goods, it would result in practically infinite shelf space. Faced with far more choice,
            consumers would shift most of their consumption to the “tail,” heralding the end of mass culture and waning
            importance of hits. If anything, Anderson underestimated the size of the tail because he didn’t anticipate
            social media. The tail is not Icelandic synth pop, as it turns out, but an endless amount of user generated
            content.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            That the Internet would yield more choice and, therefore, more fragmentation was intuitive then and is
            indisputable now. But it only tells half the story. Though it seems contradictory, the Internet both
            fragments and concentrates attention. This latter idea was explored by Anita Elberse in her book
            Blockbusters: Hit-making, Risk-taking, and the Big Business of Entertainment, which was in part a rebuttal
            to The Long Tail. But that book was more focused on why suppliers should pursue blockbuster strategies and
            less about the underlying demand-side dynamics that create hits.
